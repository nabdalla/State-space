# State-space
Bayesian particle filter for parameter inference and exposure prediction. In particular, Bayesian state space models are used by 
discretizing the differential equation models and incorporating information from observed measurements and expert prior knowledge. 
At each time point, a new measurement is available that contains some noise, so using the physical model and the available measurements, 
we try to obtain a more accurate state estimate, which can be called filtering. 
We consider a number of Monte Carlo sampling methods for parameter estimation and inference under nonlinear and non-Gaussian assumptions. 
The performance of the different methods is studied on computer-simulated and controlled laboratory-generated data. 
We consider some commonly used exposure models representing different physical hypotheses.
